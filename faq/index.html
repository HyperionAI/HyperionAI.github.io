A 90 lbs librarian will have different recommended daily values for each supplement than a 165 lbs athlete, but off the shelf store brands cannot account for this. Hyperion.AI draws from our vast user data to create a custom supplement just for you, based upon not only what very similar users have required, but your specific data as well.</div></div><div class="_1LMEl _27X1H" data-reactid="41"><div class="_2LVvq" data-reactid="42"></div><div class="_2A1o6 anim" data-reactid="43">What if my needs change over time?</div><div class="_1LTig anim" data-reactid="44">Hyperion.AI custom formulates each batch based upon up to date information. If your habits or diet change significantly, your new data input into the app will guide the program as it adjusts your mix to meet new goals and challenges.</div></div><div class="_1LMEl _27X1H" data-reactid="45"><div class="_2LVvq" data-reactid="46"></div><div class="_2A1o6 anim" data-reactid="47">What is a Neural Network?</div><div class="_1LTig anim" data-reactid="48"><!-- react-text: 49 -->Hyperion.AI uses dozens of potential ‘neurons’ as data inputs. When you set up your profile, you can tell Hyperion which of the neurons you want to activate. For example, if you want to utilize data from your Fitbit Flex, a neuron to track how many calories you burned each day will be activated. If you choose to integrate data from a smart scale, a neuron evaluating your progress towards your goal weight will be activated. In addition to the passive App Integration Neurons, there are Active Input Neurons. These neurons collect data from you directly, asking you questions periodically to determine how good you feel, how much energy you have, etc. Together these neurons construct a data profile for your individual needs on a monthly basis, to help determine the composition of your next month’s batch of supplements.<!-- /react-text --><br data-reactid="50"/><br data-reactid="51"/><!-- react-text: 52 -->The data is then combined mathematically and sent to several ‘hidden layers.’ This is where the learning takes place. Hyperion uses the error of each prediction to refine the hidden layer function, and tries again. After over 100,000 tries, Hyperion has evolved some sophisticated weights and algorithms to give nearly perfect results for each data input…and it still continues to learn and improve. As a result we now have a powerful program to determine your exact nutritional needs based upon your data, allowing us to customize your supplement mix every month to maximize your performance.<!-- /react-text --></div></div><div class="_2LVvq" data-reactid="53"></div></div><footer class="iXFpy" data-reactid="54"><div class="_2PNP-" data-reactid="55"><div class="_15kCM" data-reactid="56"><p class="_2zkQz" data-reactid="57">Hyperion</p><a class="_2cCFR" href="/plans" data-reactid="58">Products</a><a class="_2cCFR" href="/how" data-reactid="59">How It Works</a><a class="_2cCFR" href="/products" data-reactid="60">Store</a></div><div class="_15kCM" data-reactid="61"><p class="_2zkQz" data-reactid="62">Company</p><a class="_2cCFR" href="/intelligence" data-reactid="63">About Us</a><a class="_2cCFR" href="/intelligence" data-reactid="64">Support</a></div><div class="_15kCM" data-reactid="65"><p class="_2zkQz" data-reactid="66">Connect</p><a class="_2cCFR" href="/intelligence" data-reactid="67">Contact Us</a><a class="_2cCFR" href="/intelligence" data-reactid="68">Login</a></div><p class="_2aXwU" data-reactid="69">© Hyperion Industries Inc.</p></div></footer></div></div></div><script data-reactid="70"></script></div></div><script>window.__COLLECTION__ = [{"title":"Hyperion.ai","route":"faq","layout":"FAQ","description":"Tailored to Your Needs.
